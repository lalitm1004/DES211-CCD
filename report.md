### Project Brief

Tackling waste segregation is crucial for keeping both public and private spaces clean, but most existing trashcan designs aren’t actually built to prevent incorrect disposal, ensure proper category separation, or make the process user-friendly. 

Waste segregation is essential to maintaining clean, functional public and private environments—but current trashcan designs often fall short. They rarely prevent incorrect disposal, don’t make category separation intuitive or seamless, and tend to cause more issues for every design adjustment made to them. This becomes especially relevant in shared, high-footfall spaces like university campuses, where people are constantly on the move, often carrying disposable items, and directly affected by the cleanliness of their surroundings.

This project stems from on-ground observations made on campus, where poorly implemented disposal systems negatively impact hygiene and daily experience. The key stakeholders include students, staff, workers, and campus administrators, which implies essentially anyone who interacts with public waste infrastructure.

In this report, we’ll explore the common challenges people face with traditional trashcans, such as struggling to sort waste correctly, keeping it separated once it’s in, and avoiding situations where the disposal system ends up making more of a mess than it prevents. We’ll also explore straightforward, modular design and implementation improvements that address these issues head-on, hopefully coming up with an improved design that includes easy solutions to common disposal and segregation related issues.

### Problem Background and Context

Waste Segragation on the surface sounds like a very simple issue that can be fixed with having just two dustbins. But its a lot more complicated and important issue that needs to be faced upfront. Any society or community produces a lot of waste over any period of time. Proper disposal of waste is key to maintaining hygiene and functioning. A lack of care in this can result in disease and infection spreading rapidly, or on a lighter note make the environment a lot less pleasant.

This problem affects a wide variety of people, from students to workers, professors to staffs. The biggest effect is on the workers who clean the campus. If the waste is not segragated properly, the workers run the risk of catching diseases each time they dispose of waste. The risk with disposal should be minimum, ideally none, and this can be ensured with proper care taken in the collection of waste. The students are also affected by an unwell environment, their performance tanked by a lack of cleanliness. The local animals run the risk of eating some waste that is very unhealthy for them, so even they are to be accounted for here.

The problem starts with the way the dustbins are present on campus. Most dustbins are lone standing, so even if you wanted to be careful about separating different kinds of waste, chances are you wouldn't be able to do that. The lack of convenience with segragation of waste a major issue, as because of it a lot of people who would want to care about proper disposal are unable to act up on it. 

Another problem is even when there are separate bins for different kinds of waste, the bins are a lot of times toppled, by dogs or the wind, which causes a mess that requires more effort to clean up. The bins being so easy to topple adds on to the already hard problem of separation of waste. A lack of clear places to dispose of E-waste also happens to be a major issue in a university campus that has an extemely high amount of electrical devices, be it personal, professional, lab equipment etc.

The problems only begin to address the issues that are within the currently existing methods of disposal. We will try to address as many of these problems and more over this report, trying to give feasible and plausible fixes for each of them. We ran a survey to see the problems people have noticed themselves, and now we will see how we can help with them.

### Empathy Phase

**Identifying our stakeholders:**
Our major focus is on two user groups: Students and Sanitation workers.
- Students form the largest demographic on campus and are hence the largest contributors to the waste generation. Their habits and awareness (or lack thereof) heavily influence te effectiveness of any waste disposal system.
- Santitation workers regualarly interact with waste. Ensuring their safety and ease of work along with protection from potential health hazards is crucial. Any system that requires them to sort or handle the mixed waste after disposal increases theri exposure to possible biohazards and sharp or improperly discarded objects like broken glass. 

We design with both of these groups in mind to develop an effective, intuitive, safe and easy to maintain waste disposal system. 


We will focus majorly on how to make waste segragation more convenient and accessible for everyone. We aim to tackle inefficiencies and friction points in the current system that discourage proper use. A successful design will encourage users to develop positive waste habits naturally, through an environment that supports and nudges correct behavior withotu requiring constant enforcement from elsewhere.   

**Observations from the field:**
We start with observations we made ourselves while looking for how to approach the problem: 
- Lone-standing Bins: Many dustbins are placed individually rather than in groups. This results in mixed waste being thrown in the asme bin as users dont have the visibility or clarity as to whats supposed to go in the bin. And the lack of convenient options for separating make segragation harder for people to partake in. 
- Lack of awareness about E-waste: Most students are unsure of how or where to dispose of e-waste, such as batteries, chargers, or broken devices, There is little to no visible signage or designated bins for these items.
- Improper Disposal of Hazardous Materials: Items like broken glass or sharp metal pieces are often discarded with general waste, posing a direct safety threat to sanitation workers. 
- Book Disposal and Reuse: At the end of each semester, there is no organized way for students to give away or recycle their books. The traditional "raddi wala" system is inaccessible, resulting in avoidable waste.
- Increased Waste from Graduating students: Fourth Year students often dispose large quantities of belongings that they don't need anymore all at once, especially as they vacate hostels. This results in unmanageable waste surges that the current system cannot fix.
- Unmarked or Poorly marked bins: Many dustbins lack labels indicating what kind of waste should go into them. This ambiguity leads to misuse and defeats the purpose of segragation. 
- Tipped bins: Dogs frequently knock over bins, especially in the academic blocks, resulting in scattered waste and re-contamination of previously segragated waste. 

These offer very valuable insight into what problems we need to target and form the base for the changes we decided to investigate further through our survey.

**Survey and User Feedback:**
To deepen our understanding, we conducted a survey that targeted the campus residents. We asked the following key questions: 
"Insert questions"
 
These questions were framed based on our initial observations and covered a broad range of potential user pain points. The responses provided critical insights and helped valigate our earlier assumptions. 

**Pain Points:**  
These questions were designed with the problems we noticed ourselves, along with possible things we believed people would have observed. The final data of the survey lead us to the following inferences:
- A significant number of users reported difficulty in segragating their waste, especially in the absence of visual guidance or clear options on how to dispose waste. 
- Fallen or tipped-over bins are frequently observed by people, leading to scattered waste. This can cause people to be demotivated from using the bins properly.
- Users face confusion when classifying waste items - where certain materials are recyclable, degradable, or hazardous is not really clear or obvious to people. 
- An overwhelming majority of people said they have no clue on where to idspose of e-waste, highlighting a major gap in both infrastructure and awareness degarding proper procedure for disposal of such.
- Many users expressed that there are not enough designated bins for recyclable bins, making it inconvenient to practice eco-friendly habits.
- Most students reported using trashcans around 3-5 times a day, which shows the high interaction rate that each bin has for a huge campus like ours, and hence the importance of getting the design correct is even higher.
- Mixed waste was frequetly seen in bins located near hostel rooms, indicating a breakdown of the intended system.

These insights paint a clear picture of a system that needs thoughtful intervention — not just new bins, but a comprehensive redesign of the waste disposal experience. From awareness to physical infrastructure to behavioral cues, the entire process must be improved to reduce user confusion, increase sanitation worker safety, and ensure long-term sustainability.

Now we will look at existing solutions and how they have stood up to all the above noted problems. 
## Existing Solution

### Prop Up Rails
1. Pros:
   1. Makes it slightly more difficult to tip over
   2. Easy to maintain, made of stainless steel to avoid corrosion.
   3. The ability to swing the bins makes it easy for cleaning staff to take the trash out.
2. Cons:
   1. The axis of balance makes it easy for the bins to swing, which can lead to segregated waste falling out.
   2. Theyre hefty, hard to assemble (requires welding) and difficult to transport in bulk.
   3. Even these rails are lacking in most places.

### Color Coded Bins
1. Pros:
   1. Colors are distinct enough to be valid indicators
2. Cons:
   1. A lack of distinct consistent and obvious labelling, paired with color being the primary indication (possibly handicaps colorblind folk).
   2. Even color coded bins are usually lone standing on campus, causing ppl to mix waste.

### Meme Campaign
The student council put memes on nescafe tables where it was common for people to not throw away their waste.
1. Pros:
   1. Fun engaging way to incentivize disposal of waste in its appropriate bin.
   2. Didnt use guilt as a tactic.
2. Cons:
   1. The meme selections were unfunny.
   2. The poor handling of the pasting led to fungus growth, which is a biohazard.
   3. The phrasing was too verbose and dissuaded ppl from lookin at them

### Trashcan Lids
1. Pros:
   1. Keeps flies away from organic waste
   2. Obscures ppls vision from the waste
2. Cons:
   1. Lids do not fasten properly, causing them to be askew or fall off easily.
   2. The lids also introduce overhead with taking the trash out. Too many disjoint parts
   3. The openings are prone to causing trash to fall out again.
   4. The lids are designed inaccessibly because of the rquirement of users to put their hand inside to ensure proper disposal.

These solutions leave much to be desired, so we will see how we can fix those and improve upon them to give a better experience to everyone.

### Define Phase

We will now focus on the major issues that we will try to address throughout this project. Over the course of the empathy phase we recognized a lot of problems that students face, may it be problems in the existing solutions or problems in general. 


1. Intuitive Design: An intuitive design allows people to immediately undestand how the dustbin is meant to be used and where we can dispose what kinds of waste. The clear idea of what each bin is meant for reduces misuse and hesistation from people in using pins, as was observed above where people would hesistate from using bins because they werent sure of which one to use. This is crucial for proper waste segragation.
2. Sturdy Design: A strong and stable design prevents the dustbins from being easily knocked over by the dogs, wind or just accidental bumbs. This maintains the cleanliness and avoids the need to re-collect scattered waste. This ensures the system stays functional in busy parts of the campus.
3. Modularity: Modular dustbins will make it a lot more convenient to transport, assemble and install waste disposal units in a huge variety of spaces, each with their own needs and requirements. This flexibility helps drive the cost down and makes it feasible to install more dustbins in areas where they were previously lacking.
4. Proper demarcation: Clearly marked bins eliminate confusion and ensure that people will be able to dispose of their waste correctly. Use of distinct colors, textures, labels and symbols will alow people to quickly identify the approproiate bin for their waste and lead to effective segragation. This will also reduce contanmination  of recyclable materials by ensuring they end up in places where they can be sent for recycling.
5. Hygiene Features: Designs that minimize contact with the dustbins make the bins more hygienic to use, and makes people more likely to use them in a public space. This encourages usage as it reduces the risk of contamination and makes users not feel disgusted or uncomfortable when using the bins.
6. Aesthetic Appeal: Visually appealing bins that enhance their environment or blend in are more likely to be used. When the bins are not seen as dirty parts of the space, rather appealing parts that help keep the rest of the space clean, the perception among the users will become better and increase usage.

## Ideation

### Brainstorming sessions
We held brainstorming sessions to tackle each of the points in the define session one by one. This gave us a plethora of ideas that solve each problem, leaving us free to pick and choose the optimal solution.

### Sketches
Most meetings were held in library study rooms, where we drew rough sketches on the whiteboard which were then later documented on paper.
