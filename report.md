### Project Brief

Tackling waste segregation is crucial for keeping both public and private spaces clean, but most existing trashcan designs aren’t actually built to prevent incorrect disposal, ensure proper category separation, or make the process user-friendly. 

Waste segregation is essential to maintaining clean, functional public and private environments—but current trashcan designs often fall short. They rarely prevent incorrect disposal, don’t make category separation intuitive or seamless, and tend to cause more issues for every design adjustment made to them. This becomes especially relevant in shared, high-footfall spaces like university campuses, where people are constantly on the move, often carrying disposable items, and directly affected by the cleanliness of their surroundings.

This project stems from on-ground observations made on campus, where poorly implemented disposal systems negatively impact hygiene and daily experience. The key stakeholders include students, staff, workers, and campus administrators, which implies essentially anyone who interacts with public waste infrastructure.

In this report, we’ll explore the common challenges people face with traditional trashcans, such as struggling to sort waste correctly, keeping it separated once it’s in, and avoiding situations where the disposal system ends up making more of a mess than it prevents. We’ll also explore straightforward, modular design and implementation improvements that address these issues head-on, hopefully coming up with an improved design that includes easy solutions to common disposal and segregation related issues.

### Problem Background and Context

Waste Segragation on the surface sounds like a very simple issue that can be fixed with having just two dustbins. But its a lot more complicated and important issue that needs to be faced upfront. Any society or community produces a lot of waste over any period of time. Proper disposal of waste is key to maintaining hygiene and functioning. A lack of care in this can result in disease and infection spreading rapidly, or on a lighter note make the environment a lot less pleasant.

This problem affects a wide variety fo people, from students to workers, professors to staffs. The biggest effect is on the workers who clean the campus. If the waste is not segragated properly, the workers run the risk of catching some disease each time they dispose of waste. The risk with disposal should be minimum, ideally none, and this can be ensured with proper care taken in the collection of waste. The students are also affected by an unwell environment, their performance tanked by a lack of cleanliness. The local animals run the risk of eating some waste that is very unhealthy for them, so even they are to be accounted for here.

The problem starts with the way the dustbins are present on campus. Most dustbins are lone standing, so even if you wanted to be careful about separating different kinds of waste, chances are you wouldn't be able to do that. The lack of convenience with segragation of waste a major issue, as because of it a lot of people who would want to care about proper disposal are unable to act up on it. 

Another problem is even when there are separate bins for different kinds of waste, the bins are a lot of times toppled, by dogs or the wind, which causes a mess that requires more effort to clean up. The bins being so easy to topple adds on to the already hard problem of separation of waste. A lack of clear places to dispose of E-waste also happens to be a major issue in a university campus that has an extemely high amount of electrical devices, be it personal, professional, lab equipment etc.

The problems only begin to address the issues that are within the currently existing methods of disposal. We will try to address as many of these problems and more over this report, trying to give feasible and plausible fixes for each of them. We ran a survey to see the problems people have noticed themselves, and now we will see how we can help with them.
