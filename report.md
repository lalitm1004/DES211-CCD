### Project Brief

Tackling waste segregation is crucial for keeping both public and private spaces clean, but most existing trashcan designs aren’t actually built to prevent incorrect disposal, ensure proper category separation, or make the process user-friendly. 

Waste segregation is essential to maintaining clean, functional public and private environments—but current trashcan designs often fall short. They rarely prevent incorrect disposal, don’t make category separation intuitive or seamless, and tend to cause more issues for every design adjustment made to them. This becomes especially relevant in shared, high-footfall spaces like university campuses, where people are constantly on the move, often carrying disposable items, and directly affected by the cleanliness of their surroundings.

This project stems from on-ground observations made on campus, where poorly implemented disposal systems negatively impact hygiene and daily experience. The key stakeholders include students, staff, workers, and campus administrators, which implies essentially anyone who interacts with public waste infrastructure.

In this report, we’ll explore the common challenges people face with traditional trashcans, such as struggling to sort waste correctly, keeping it separated once it’s in, and avoiding situations where the disposal system ends up making more of a mess than it prevents. We’ll also explore straightforward, modular design and implementation improvements that address these issues head-on, hopefully coming up with an improved design that includes easy solutions to common disposal and segregation related issues.
