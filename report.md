### Project Brief

Tackling waste segregation is crucial for keeping both public and private spaces clean, but most existing trashcan designs aren’t actually built to prevent incorrect disposal, ensure proper category separation, or make the process user-friendly. 

Waste segregation is essential to maintaining clean, functional public and private environments—but current trashcan designs often fall short. They rarely prevent incorrect disposal, don’t make category separation intuitive or seamless, and tend to cause more issues for every design adjustment made to them. This becomes especially relevant in shared, high-footfall spaces like university campuses, where people are constantly on the move, often carrying disposable items, and directly affected by the cleanliness of their surroundings.

This project stems from on-ground observations made on campus, where poorly implemented disposal systems negatively impact hygiene and daily experience. The key stakeholders include students, staff, workers, and campus administrators, which implies essentially anyone who interacts with public waste infrastructure.

In this report, we’ll explore the common challenges people face with traditional trashcans, such as struggling to sort waste correctly, keeping it separated once it’s in, and avoiding situations where the disposal system ends up making more of a mess than it prevents. We’ll also explore straightforward, modular design and implementation improvements that address these issues head-on, hopefully coming up with an improved design that includes easy solutions to common disposal and segregation related issues.

### Problem Background and Context

Waste Segragation on the surface sounds like a very simple issue that can be fixed with having just two dustbins. But its a lot more complicated and important issue that needs to be faced upfront. Any society or community produces a lot of waste over any period of time. Proper disposal of waste is key to maintaining hygiene and functioning. A lack of care in this can result in disease and infection spreading rapidly, or on a lighter note make the environment a lot less pleasant.

This problem affects a wide variety fo people, from students to workers, professors to staffs. The biggest effect is on the workers who clean the campus. If the waste is not segragated properly, the workers run the risk of catching some disease each time they dispose of waste. The risk with disposal should be minimum, ideally none, and this can be ensured with proper care taken in the collection of waste. The students are also affected by an unwell environment, their performance tanked by a lack of cleanliness. The local animals run the risk of eating some waste that is very unhealthy for them, so even they are to be accounted for here.

The problem starts with the way the dustbins are present on campus. Most dustbins are lone standing, so even if you wanted to be careful about separating different kinds of waste, chances are you wouldn't be able to do that. The lack of convenience with segragation of waste a major issue, as because of it a lot of people who would want to care about proper disposal are unable to act up on it. 

Another problem is even when there are separate bins for different kinds of waste, the bins are a lot of times toppled, by dogs or the wind, which causes a mess that requires more effort to clean up. The bins being so easy to topple adds on to the already hard problem of separation of waste. A lack of clear places to dispose of E-waste also happens to be a major issue in a university campus that has an extemely high amount of electrical devices, be it personal, professional, lab equipment etc.

The problems only begin to address the issues that are within the currently existing methods of disposal. We will try to address as many of these problems and more over this report, trying to give feasible and plausible fixes for each of them. We ran a survey to see the problems people have noticed themselves, and now we will see how we can help with them.

### Empathy Phase

As stated above, the users we will focus on majorly are students and workers. The students make up the majority of the population on campus and hence produce the most amount of waste. And sanitation workers are to interact with this waste consistently, so they must not be at any risk of infections while dealing with it.

We will focus majorly on how to make waste segragation more convenient and accessible for everyone with any changes in the current system of disposal that are currently inhibiting these. The system should allow for people to naturally develop good habits regarding waste, in both the disposal and segragating while disposing.   

We start with observations we made ourselves while looking for how to approach the problem: 
- A lot of dustbins on campus are lonestanding. This obviously results in all categories of waste being disposed off together, which is not ideal.
- No one knows how to dispose of e-waste, no awareness etc. Degradable and non-degradable arent the only two categories.
- Like the previous point, glass shards cannot be thrown with regular waste due to safety concerns.
- At the end of semesters, students cannot easily exchange their used books with the raddi wala.
- Specifically for 4th years, they are not going to utilize the cloakroom facility, and will dispose of a lot more waste.
- Most bins are not marked with the appropriate waste category.
- Dogs tip over pre-segregated bins which ruins all effort.

These offer very valuable insight into what problems we can target right off the bat. However these observations are compounded by the results we got from our survery.
We conducted a survey that asked users the following questions:
"Insert questions here"
 
These questions were designed with the problems we noticed ourselves, along with possible things we believed people would have observed. The final data of the survey lead us to the following inferences:
- Most people face issues with segregation
- People notice fallen dustbins frequently
- Majority of people face issues with classifying waste
- Overwhelming majority of people dont know where to dispose e-waste
- Overwhelming majority of people feel there is a lack of places to dispose of recyclable waste
- People use trashcans 3-5 times a day
- People notice mixed waste in bins outside their hostel rooms very frequently

With these, we can see that a lot of issues that people have observed, and now we will look at the existing solutions and see how we can improve upon them all.

## Existing Solution

### Prop Up Rails
1. Pros:
   1. Makes it slightly more difficult to tip over
   2. Easy to maintain, made of stainless steel to avoid corrosion.
   3. The ability to swing the bins makes it easy for cleaning staff to take the trash out.
2. Cons:
   1. The axis of balance makes it easy for the bins to swing, which can lead to segregated waste falling out.
   2. Theyre hefty, hard to assemble (requires welding) and difficult to transport in bulk.
   3. Even these rails are lacking in most places.

### Color Coded Bins
1. Pros:
   1. Colors are distinct enough to be valid indicators
2. Cons:
   1. A lack of distinct consistent and obvious labelling, paired with color being the primary indication (possibly handicaps colorblind folk).
   2. Even color coded bins are usually lone standing on campus, causing ppl to mix waste.

### Meme Campaign
The student council put memes on nescafe tables where it was common for ppl to not throw away their waste.
1. Pros:
   1. Fun engaging way to incentivize disposal of waste in its appropriate bin.2
   2. Didnt use guilt as a tactic.
2. Cons:
   1. The meme selections were unfunny.
   2. The poor handling of the pasting led to fungus growth, which is a biohazard.
   3. The phrasing was too verbose and dissuaded ppl from lookin at them

### Trashcan Lids
1. Pros:
   1. Keeps flies away from organic waste
   2. Obscures ppls vision from the waste
2. Cons:
   1. Lids do not fasten properly, causing them to be askew or fall off easily.
   2. The lids also introduce overhead with taking the trash out. Too many disjoint parts
   3. The openings are prone to causing trash to fall out again.
   4. The lids are designed inaccessibly because of the rquirement of users to put their hand inside to ensure proper disposal.

These solutions leave much to be desired, so we will see how we can fix those and improve upon them to give a better experience to everyone.
