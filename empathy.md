# Empathy Phase

# RESTRICT SCOPE TO CAMPUS

## Goals
1. Collect data from people to understand what exactly they face problems with.

## Observations
- A lot of dustbins on campus are lonestanding. This obviously results in all categories of waste being disposed off together, which is not ideal.
- No one knows how to dispose of e-waste, no awareness etc. Degradable and non-degradable arent the only two categories.
- Like the previous point, glass shards cannot be thrown with regular waste due to safety concerns.
- At the end of semesters, students cannot easily exchange their used books with the raddi wala.
- Specifically for 4th years, they are not going to utilize the cloakroom facility, and will dispose of a lot more waste.
- Most bins are not marked with the appropriate waste category.
- Dogs tip over pre-segregated bins which ruins all effort.
