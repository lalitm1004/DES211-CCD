# Empathy Phase

# RESTRICT SCOPE TO CAMPUS

## Goals
1. Collect data from people to understand what exactly they face problems with.

## Observations
- A lot of dustbins on campus are lonestanding. This obviously results in all categories of waste being disposed off together, which is not ideal.
- No one knows how to dispose of e-waste, no awareness etc. Degradable and non-degradable arent the only two categories.
- Like the previous point, glass shards cannot be thrown with regular waste due to safety concerns.
- At the end of semesters, students cannot easily exchange their used books with the raddi wala.
- Specifically for 4th years, they are not going to utilize the cloakroom facility, and will dispose of a lot more waste.
- Most bins are not marked with the appropriate waste category.
- Dogs tip over pre-segregated bins which ruins all effort.

## Survey Questions
1. Do you face any problems with easy waste segregation on campus?
> Yes
> Neutral
> No

2. How often have you noticed fallen bins on campus (whether or not a dog tipped it over)?
> range

3. Do you have trouble classifying waste and which dustbin it should go in?
> trilean

4. Do you know where to dispose of e-waste?
> boolean

5. Do you feel that there is a lack of places to dispose of recyclable waste?
> trilean

6. How many plastic bottles do you go through every month?
> range

7. How many notebooks do you go through every month?
> range

8. On an average day, how often do you use a trashcan on campus?
> range

9. How much thought do you put into disposing trash on-hand in day to day situations?
> range

10. How often do you find mixed waste in the dustbins outside your hostel rooms?
> range

## Existing Solution

### Prop Up Rails
1. Pros:
   1. Makes it slightly more difficult to tip over
   2. Easy to maintain, made of stainless steel to avoid corrosion.
   3. The ability to swing the bins makes it easy for cleaning staff to take the trash out.
2. Cons:
   1. The axis of balance makes it easy for the bins to swing, which can lead to segregated waste falling out.
   2. Theyre hefty, hard to assemble (requires welding) and difficult to transport in bulk.
   3. Even these rails are lacking in most places.

### Color Coded Bins
1. Pros:
   1. Colors are distinct enough to be valid indicators
2. Cons:
   1. A lack of distinct consistent and obvious labelling, paired with color being the primary indication (possibly handicaps colorblind folk).
   2. Even color coded bins are usually lone standing on campus, causing ppl to mix waste.

### Meme Campaign
The student council put memes on nescafe tables where it was common for ppl to not throw away their waste.
1. Pros:
   1. Fun engaging way to incentivize disposal of waste in its appropriate bin.2
   2. Didnt use guilt as a tactic.
2. Cons:
   1. The meme selections were unfunny.
   2. The poor handling of the pasting led to fungus growth, which is a biohazard.
   3. The phrasing was too verbose and dissuaded ppl from lookin at them

### Trashcan Lids
1. Pros:
   1. Keeps flies away from organic waste
   2. Obscures ppls vision from the waste
2. Cons:
   1. Lids do not fasten properly, causing them to be askew or fall off easily.
   2. The lids also introduce overhead with taking the trash out. Too many disjoint parts
   3. The openings are prone to causing trash to fall out again.
   4. The lids are designed inaccessibly because of the rquirement of users to put their hand inside to ensure proper disposal.
