Problem Statement:
> Waste segregation is crucial for efficient recycling and waste management,
> yet existing dustbins often make it difficult for users to properly separate biodegradable, recyclable, and non-recyclable waste.
> Many dustbins lack intuitive design, leading to incorrect disposal, contamination of recyclable materials, and inefficiencies in waste processing.
> A redesigned dustbin system is needed to encourage and simplify proper waste segregation.# Minesweeper
