# Definition Phase

## Survey
- Most ppl face issues with segregation
- Ppl notice fallen dustbins frequently
- Majority of ppl face issues with classifying waste
- Overwhelming majority of ppl dont know where to dispose e-waste
- Overwhelming majority of ppl feel there is a lack of places to dispose of recyclable waste
- Ppl use trashcans 3-5 times a day
- Ppl notice mixed waste in bins outside their hostel rooms very frequently

## Define

### 1st Iteration
- No obvious demarkation of purpose
- Tipping over of dustbins causes any prior segregation to go to waste, therefore they must be difficult to tip over.
- On campus, a lot of dustbins are lone standing and in need of modularity for obvious reasons.
    - The dustbins need to be cheap and easy to install to further motivate university cleanliness
- Capacity needs to be increased, further adds to the modularity point.
- Room wise segregation is not possible, therefore we need floor wise segregation (maybe tackled with awareness).
- No incentive to segregate waste.

### 2nd Iteration
- The idea of touching bins/putting their hands in them causes immediate discomfort in ppl
- Bidirectionality of lids is redundant since bins are usually places next to walls. An open bin would be more accessible from more directions.
- We still want to hide away the trash since its visually displeasing and unhygenic.


## 3rd Iteration (Final)
- Adaptability for all types of bins (single, multiple, non supported and supported).
- Ability to quickly install/remove lids for repurposing.
- Non vertical openings to prevent overflow.
- As low contact as possible (for the user)
- Color and textual/design cues for obvious demarkation.
- Adaptablity to specific/different criteria of segregation (adding different categories of bins based on location/requirement).
- Easy method to swap in and out labels for dustbins.
- Availability of different colors.
