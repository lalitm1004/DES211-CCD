# Definition Phase

## Survey
- Most ppl face issues with segregation
- Ppl notice fallen dustbins frequently
- Majority of ppl face issues with classifying waste
- Overwhelming majority of ppl dont know where to dispose e-waste
- Overwhelming majority of ppl feel there is a lack of places to dispose of recyclable waste
- Ppl use trashcans 3-5 times a day
- Ppl notice mixed waste in bins outside their hostel rooms very frequently

## Define

### 1st Iteration
- No obvious demarkation of purpose
- Tipping over of dustbins causes any prior segregation to go to waste, therefore they must be difficult to tip over.
- On campus, a lot of dustbins are lone standing and in need of modularity for obvious reasons.
    - The dustbins need to be cheap and easy to install to further motivate university cleanliness
- Capacity needs to be increased, further adds to the modularity point.
- Room wise segregation is not possible, therefore we need floor wise segregation (maybe tackled with awareness).
- No incentive to segregate waste.

### 2nd Iteration
- The idea of touching bins/putting their hands in them causes immediate discomfort in ppl
- Bidirectionality of lids is redundant since bins are usually places next to walls. An open bin would be more accessible from more directions.
- We still want to hide away the trash since its visually displeasing and unhygenic.


## 3rd Iteration (Final)
- Adaptability for all types of bins (single, multiple, non supported and supported).
- Ability to quickly install/remove lids for repurposing.
- Non vertical openings to prevent overflow.
- As low contact as possible (for the user)
- Color and textual/design cues for obvious demarkation.
- Adaptablity to specific/different criteria of segregation (adding different categories of bins based on location/requirement).
- Easy method to swap in and out labels for dustbins.
- Availability of different colors.

> 
>“From our observations and the survey, we’ve identified the key failure points in the current system—and what needs to change.”

> 
>“First, the obvious: there is no clear demarcation of bin purpose. Without strong visual or text cues, people default to convenience. Next, bin instability—dogs or even the wind knock them over, nullifying any prior segregation. Third, our bins are isolated, not modular—so they don't support categorization in a coherent way.”

> 
>“Many students express disgust at the idea of touching bin lids or peeking inside to check what’s already there. Hygiene and usability aren’t separate—they’re interdependent.”

> 
>“Our solution must address: 
> - Visual clarity: through color, labels, and icons.
> - Stability: to prevent tipping over.
> - Low contact design: that respects hygiene concerns.
> - Modularity: so bins can be installed in combinations fit for different areas.

> 
>“This isn’t just about better dustbins. It’s about systems that respect human behavior. Because when design leads with empathy and clarity, good habits follow naturally.”
